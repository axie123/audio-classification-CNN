# audio-classification-CNN

## About this Project

Audio Classification on Urban Sounds 8K dataset. 

We iteratively designed a CNN model that can classify 10 different sounds with 94.60% accuracy. The key is to use Mel-Frequency Cesptral Coefficients (MFCCs) to turn the audio points into a spatial representation.
